        study_selection_criteria: 'The nephrology data set was restricted to interventional study types registered in the larger data set between October 1, 2007, and September 27, 2010 (n 5 40,970 of 94,346; Fig 1). Noninterventional studies (such as observational or cohort studies) were eliminated to minimize bias related to the lack of reporting requirements for these studies. The data set was created by using disease-specific condition terms (both Medical Subject Headings [MeSH] and non-MeSH) that were provided by the data sub- mitters, and additional MeSH terms that were generated by a National Library of Medicine algorithm. Investigators at Duke reviewed 18,491 records from the MeSH dictionary, and terms were annotated according to their relevance to nephrology. MeSH terms with conflicting tags (ie, multiple records in the dictionary) were adjudicated by the investigators. Of the 9,031 unique MeSH terms individually adjudicated, 83 were tagged to be nephrology- specific (Item S1, available as online supplementary material). Also, investigators reviewed 1,220 unique, common, free-text terms and identified 31 nephrology-specific terms.
An initial data set of 998 studies was identified as having conditions relevant to nephrology. Another 80 studies (identified by additional key words and free text) were added. In total, 1,078 studies were individually reviewed by 2 nephrologists (brief title, key words, conditions, MeSH terms, and if necessary, the full ClinicalTrials.gov record) to determine relevance to nephrology. In total, 24 studies were excluded as irrelevant to nephrology, leaving a final data set of 1,054 studies. Similar methods were used to identify 2,325 cardiology studies17; 61 studies that also were in the nephrology group were excluded, resulting in a subset of 2,264 cardiology studies used for comparison in this analysis. The remaining group of “other” studies (n 5 37,652) includes those not classified as nephrology or cardiology.'
