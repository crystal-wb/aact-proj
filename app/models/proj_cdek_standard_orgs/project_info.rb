     description:   ' Clinical Drug Experience Knowledgebase (CDEK) is a database and web-platform to enable researchers and analysts to study all active pharmaceutical ingredients with evidence of clinical experience in humans. CDEK contains over 20,000 active pharmaceutical ingredients with surrounding annotated metadata (i.e. sponsoring organizations, indications, clinical trial data, chemical structure, etc). We curated CDEK in part by disambiguating intervention and organization names from ClinicalTrials.gov (through AACT). This information was cross-referenced against entries in prominent international drug databases (e.g. PubChem, ChEMBL, DrugBank). We have a prototype web-application designed to allow researchers of all backgrounds to access and query the data (cdek.wustl.edu).'
