        study_selection_criteria: "Our analysis was restricted to interventional studies registered with ClinicalTrials.gov between October 2007 and September 2010. To identify interventional studies, we used studies.study_type which provides the following choices: interventional, observational, expanded access, and not available (NA). Interventional studies were regrouped within the downloaded, derivative database according to the 3 clinical specialtiesâ€”cardiovascular, oncology, and mental health. For this regrouping, we used submitted disease condition terms and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms generated by a National Library of Medicine (NLM) algorithm to develop a methodology to annotate, validate, adjudicate, and implement disease condition terms (MeSH and non-MeSH) to create specialty data sets.

A subset of the 2010 MeSH thesaurus from the NLM21 and a list of non-MeSH disease condition terms provided by data submitters that appeared in 5 or more interventional studies in the analysis data set were reviewed and annotated by clinical specialists at Duke University Medical Center. Terms were annotated according to their relevance to a given specialty (Y = relevant, N = not relevant). Specialty data sets were created and the results of algorithmic classifications were validated by comparison with classifications based on manual review. Clinical trials were classed according to date registered and by interventional status.",
