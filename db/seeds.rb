Clinwiki is currently under development. A preliminary version is available at the link provided.',

  description: "The informatics team and business development at Duke Clinical Research Institute asked us to identify locations where EEG-related clinical trials are and have been conducted, and which of these studies are currently recruiting. We downloaded the most recent version of AACT and created a search function to return the NCT ID for studies where keywords, interventions or titles included the term 'EEG', 'Electroencephalogram' or 'Electroencephalography'. We used those IDs to generate a view of clinical trial information and referred a Tableau workbook to this view by defining it as the data source. The Tableau workbook attached here provides some of the graphics developed. (You will need to connect to the AACT database through a PostgreSQL connection using the credentials found at the bottom of the AACT website's Connect page. (Note, this use case was initially created in Spring, 2016 to serve as a proof of concept and help us design/develop AACT. The url provided is a link to a website that presents a preliminary version of the visualizations that were first created in May, 2016.)",

  description: "We accessed the AACT database using SAS(R) v 9.4. Our analysis was restricted to interventional studies registered between 2008-2017. We classified trials according to Funding source (Industry/NIH/Other, derived from sponsor and collaborator fields), Phase, Intervention Type, Site Location (U.S. sites compared to sites in the rest of the world), and appointment of a Data Monitoring Committee. We also examined patterns in months from study start to completion, and in months from study completion to reporting of results at ClinicalTrials.gov in selected subgroups of studies. In this version we examined completeness of a few of the new data elements (e.g., about inclusion of a US FDA regulated drug product). An example graph is displayed in the image file displayed above. The attached Excel file displays additional graphs. To create the Excel file we generated summary numbers from SAS, output them, and created the graphs in Excel. Graphs were also generated directly using SAS procedures and output to a PDF file (see code and output shared via GitHub).",
